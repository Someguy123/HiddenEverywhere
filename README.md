#HiddenEverywhere
A Firefox add-on to help Tor users find hidden services for ClearNet sites they use every day.

Often, I tell people of [Facebook's hidden service](http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/10/facebook-offers-hidden-service-to-tor-users/) only to hear they didn't know. It's been around since 2014, offering Tor users additional security, compared to the Clearnet.

The most recent encounter with someone who actively used Tor for their daily activities had me think, "what if Firefox could tell you when a site you're using has a hidden service, even if you're stuck behind a Cloudflare Captcha?".

And thus, this extension was born. When you visit a site such as [LiteVault.net](https://www.litevault.net) or Facebook.com, the extension will inform you that you should be using the hidden service, with a direct link to it.

For your privacy, this extension makes NO HTTP REQUESTS, and it does not log your requests in any form. The extension checks against a local text file, containing a list of websites and their verified hidden services.
